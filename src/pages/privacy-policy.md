# Privacy Policy

Last updated: February 01, 2024

Your privacy is critically important to us. At Chrono, we have a few fundamental principles:

-   We are thoughtful about the personal information we ask you to provide and the personal information that we collect about you through the operation of our services.
-   We store personal information for only as long as we have a reason to keep it.
-   We aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what information on your website is shared publicly (or kept private), indexed by search engines, and permanently deleted.
-   We help protect you from overreaching government demands for your personal information.
-   We aim for full transparency on how we gather, use, and share your personal information.

Below is our Privacy Policy, which incorporates and clarifies these principles.

### Who We Are and What This Policy Covers

We are the developers of Chrono, an open-source calendar application designed to empower users to analyze and track their time effectively. Whether you're an individual or a business, our goal is to equip you with powerful time management capabilities while staying committed to the ideals of the open web.

We champion the democratization of productivity and time management, offering a solution that helps users optimize their schedules and make informed decisions.

True to our philosophy, Chrono's underlying code is released under the GNU Affero General Public License ("AGPL"), ensuring transparency and community contribution. With the majority of our work freely accessible, users can examine and understand the inner workings of the application, contributing to its growth and improvement.

This Privacy Policy applies to information that we collect about you when you use:
- Our web application Chrono (rechrono.com)
- Our mobile applications
- Our other Chrono products, services, and features that are available on or through our websites; and
- Other users' websites that use our Services, while you are logged in to your account with us.

This Privacy Policy also applies to information we collect when you apply for a job at Chrono or one of our subsidiaries.

Throughout this Privacy Policy we'll refer to our websites, mobile applications, and other products and services collectively as "Services." 

Below we explain how we collect, use, and share information about you, along with the choices that you have with respect to that information.

### Information We Collect

We only collect information about you if we have a reason to do so — for example, to provide our Services, to communicate with you, or to make our Services better.

We collect this information from three sources: if and when you provide information to us, automatically through operating our Services, and from outside sources. Let's go over the information that we collect.

#### *Information You Provide to Us*

It's probably no surprise that we collect information that you provide to us directly. Here are some examples:

-  **Basic account information:** We ask for basic information from you in order to set up your account. For example, we require individuals who connect with their google workspace account to provide an email address and calendar, along with a username or name — and that's it.
-  **Public profile information:** If you have an account with us, we collect the information that you provide for your public calendar. For example, if you have a Chrono calendar set to public, your username and calendar details will be part of the public profile, along with any other information you put into your public profile, like a photo or an "About Me" description. Your public profile information is just that — public — so please keep that in mind when deciding what information you would like to include.
-  **Payment and contact information:** There are various ways in which you may provide us payment information and associated contact information. If you buy a subscription to a hosted rechrono.com subscription, you'll provide additional personal and payment information like your name, credit card information, and contact information. 
-  **Content information:** You might provide us with information about you in draft and published content (a blog post or comment that includes biographic information about you, or any media or files you upload).
- **Credentials:** Depending on the Services you use, you may provide us with credentials for your self-hosted website (like SSH, FTP, and SFTP username and password). Jetpack and VaultPress users may provide us with these credentials in order to use our one-click restore feature if there is a problem with their site, or to allow us to troubleshoot problems more quickly.
- **Communications with us (hi there!):** You may also provide us with information when you respond to surveys, communicate with our Engineers about a support question, or post a question in our public forums. When you communicate with us via form, email, phone, or otherwise, we store a copy of our communications (including any call recordings as permitted by applicable law).

#### *Information We Collect Automatically*

We also collect some information automatically:

-  **Log information:** Like most online service providers, we collect information that web browsers, mobile devices, and servers typically make available, including the browser type, IP address, unique device identifiers, language preference, referring site, the date and time of access, operating system, and mobile network information. We collect log information when you use our Services — for example, when you create or make changes to calendars in the Chrono app on rechrono.com.
-  **Transactional information:** When you make a purchase through our Services, we collect information about the transaction, such as product details, purchase price, and the date and location of the transaction. 
-  **Usage information:** We collect information about your usage of our Services. We may also collect information that your browser sends whenever you visit our Service or when you access Service by or through a mobile device (“Usage Data”). This Usage Data may include information such as your computer's Internet Protocol address (e.g. IP address), browser type, browser version, the pages of our Service that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages, unique device identifiers and other diagnostic data. We use this information to, for example, provide our Services to you, get insights on how people use our Services so we can make our Services better, and understand and make predictions about user retention.
-  **Location information:** We may determine the approximate location of your device from your IP address. We collect and use this information to, for example, calculate how many people visit our Services from certain geographic regions. We may also collect information about your precise location via our mobile apps (like when you post a photograph with location information) if you allow us to do so through your mobile device operating system's permissions.
-  **Stored information:** We may access information stored on your mobile device via our mobile apps. We access this stored information through your device operating system's permissions. For example, if you give us permission to access the photographs on your mobile device's camera roll, our Services may access the photos stored on your device when you upload a really amazing photograph of the sunrise to your website.
-  **Information from cookies & other technologies:** A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Pixel tags (also called web beacons) are small blocks of code placed on websites and emails. Chrono uses cookies and other technologies like pixel tags to help us identify and track visitors, usage, and access preferences for our Services, as well as track and understand email campaign effectiveness and to deliver targeted ads. You can instruct your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, if you do not accept cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of our Service.

#### *Information We Collect from Other Sources*

We may also get information about you from other sources. For example:

-  **Third Party Login:** If you create or log in to your rechrono.com account through another service (like Google) we'll receive associated login information (e.g. a connection token, your username, your email address)
-  **Social Sharing Services:** If you connect your website or account to a social media service (like Google and Miscrosoft), we'll receive information from that service (e.g., your username, basic profile information, friends list) via the authorization procedures for that service.
-  **Google Account Information:** When you connect your Google account to your Calendar, we  access certain Google user data such as your Google Calendar account and Google Contacts to manage analytics features more seamlessly. For example, you can see meeting and contact statistics directly in your Chrono dashboard.

The information we receive depends on which services you use or authorize and what options are available.

Third-party services may also give us information, like mailing addresses for individuals who are not yet our users (but we hope will be!). We use this information for marketing purposes like postcards and other mailers advertising our Services.

### How and Why We Use Information

#### *Purposes for Using Information*

We use information about you for the purposes listed below:

-  **To provide our Services.** For example, to set up and maintain your account, host your website, backup and restore your website, provide customer service, process payments and orders, and verify user information.
-  **To ensure quality, maintain safety, and improve our Services.** For example, by providing automatic upgrades and new versions of our Services. Or, for example, by monitoring and analyzing how users interact with our Services so we can create new features that we think our users will enjoy and that will help them create and manage websites more efficiently or make our Services easier to use.
-  **To place and manage ads in our advertising program.** For example, to place ads on our users' sites and some of our own sites as part of our advertising program, and understand ad performance.
-  **To market our Services and measure, gauge, and improve the effectiveness of our marketing.** For example, by targeting our marketing messages to groups of our users (like those who have a particular plan with us or have been users for a certain length of time), advertising our Services, analyzing the results of our marketing campaigns (like how many people purchased a paid plan after receiving a marketing message), and understanding and forecasting user retention.
-  **To protect our Services, our users, and the public.** For example, by detecting security incidents; detecting and protecting against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity; fighting spam; complying with our legal obligations; and protecting the rights and property of Chrono and others, which may result in us, for example, declining a transaction or terminating Services.
- **To fix problems with our Services.** For example, by monitoring, debugging, repairing, and preventing issues.
- **To customize the user experience.** For example, to personalize your experience by serving you relevant notifications and advertisements for our Services, recommending content through our Reader post suggestions, and providing new essays and stories through Longreads for your reading pleasure.
- **To communicate with you.** For example, by emailing you to ask for your feedback, share tips for getting the most out of our products, or keep you up to date on Chrono; texting you to verify your payment; or calling you to share offers and promotions that we think will be of interest to you. If you don't want to hear from us, you can opt out of marketing communications at any time. (If you opt out, we'll still send you important updates relating to your account.)

#### *Legal Bases for Collecting and Using Information*

A note here for those in the European Union about our legal grounds for processing information about you under EU data protection laws, which is that our use of your information is based on the grounds that:

(1) The use is necessary in order to fulfill our commitments to you under the applicable terms of service or other agreements with you or is necessary to administer your account — for example, in order to enable access to our website on your device or charge you for a paid plan; or

(2) The use is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation; or

(3) The use is necessary in order to protect your vital interests or those of another person; or

(4) We have a legitimate interest in using your information — for example, to provide and update our Services; to improve our Services so that we can offer you an even better user experience; to safeguard our Services; to communicate with you; to measure, gauge, and improve the effectiveness of our advertising; and to understand our user retention and attrition; to monitor and prevent any problems with our Services; and to personalize your experience; or

(5) You have given us your consent — for example before we place certain cookies on your device and access and analyze them later on.

### Sharing Information

#### *How We Share Information*

We share information about you in limited circumstances, and with appropriate safeguards on your privacy. These are spelled out below.

-  **Subsidiaries and independent contractors:** We may disclose information about you to our subsidiaries and independent contractors who need the information to help us provide our Services or process the information on our behalf. We require our subsidiaries and independent contractors to follow this Privacy Policy for any personal information that we share with them.
-  **Third-party vendors:** We may share information about you with third-party vendors who need the information in order to provide their services to us, or to provide their services to you or your site. This includes vendors that help us provide our Services to you. These include Stripe, a payment providers that process your credit and debit card information, fraud prevention services that allow us to analyze fraudulent payment transactions, cloud storage services, postal and email delivery services that help us stay in touch with you, customer chat and email support services that help us communicate with you; those that assist us with our marketing efforts (e.g., by providing tools for identifying a specific marketing target group or improving our marketing campaigns, and by placing ads to market our services); those that help us understand and enhance our Services (like analytics providers); those that make tools to help us run our operations (like programs that help us with task management, scheduling, word processing, email and other communications, and collaboration among our teams); other third-party tools that help us manage operations; and companies that make products available on our websites, who may need information about you in order to, for example, provide technical or other support services to you. We require vendors to agree to privacy commitments in order to share information with them. 
-  **Legal and regulatory requirements:** We may disclose information about you in response to a subpoena, court order, or other governmental request. For more information on how we respond to requests for information about WordPress.com users, please see our [Legal Guidelines](https://en.support.wordpress.com/report-blogs/legal-guidelines/). Additionally, if you have a domain registered with WordPress.com, we may share your information to comply with the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers' (ICANN) regulations, rules, or policies. For example, your information relating to your domain registration may be available in the WHOIS database, or we may be required to share your information with ICANN-approved Dispute Resolution Service Providers. Please see our [Domain Registrations and Privacy support document](https://en.support.wordpress.com/domains/domain-registrations-and-privacy/) for more details.
-  **To protect rights, property, and others:** We may disclose information about you when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Chrono, third parties, or the public at large. For example, if we have a good faith belief that there is an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury, we [may disclose information related to the emergency without delay](https://en.support.wordpress.com/report-blogs/legal-guidelines/#emergency-requests-from-government-agencieslaw-enforcement).
-  **Business transfers:** In connection with any merger, sale of company assets, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company, or in the unlikely event that Chrono goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would likely be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. If any of these events were to happen, this Privacy Policy would continue to apply to your information and the party receiving your information may continue to use your information, but only consistent with this Privacy Policy.
-  **With your consent:** We may share and disclose information with your consent or at your direction. For example, we may share your information with third parties when you authorize us to do so, like when you connected your site to a social media service through our Publicize feature.
-  **Aggregated or de-identified information:** We may share information that has been aggregated or de-identified, so that it can no longer reasonably be used to identify you. For instance, we may publish aggregate statistics about the use of our Services, or share a hashed version of your email address to facilitate customized ad campaigns on other platforms.
-  **Published support requests:** If you send us a request for assistance (for example, via a support email or one of our other feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish that request in order to clarify or respond to your request, or to help us support other users.

#### *Information Shared Publicly*

Information that you choose to make public is disclosed publicly.

That means information like your public profile, posts, other content that you make public on your website, and your "Likes" and comments on other websites are all available to others — and we hope they get a lot of views!

For example, the photo that you upload to your public profile, or a default image if you haven't uploaded one, is your **G**lobally **R**ecognized Avatar, or Gravatar — get it? :) Your Gravatar, along with other public profile information, displays alongside the comments and "Likes" that you make on other users' websites while logged in to your WordPress.com account. Your Gravatar and public profile information may also display with your comments, "Likes," and other interactions on websites that use our Gravatar service, if the email address associated with your account is the same email address you use on the other website.

Please keep all of this in mind when deciding what you would like to share publicly.

#### *Google API Services User Data Policy*

(Chrono's) use and transfer to any other app of information received from Google APIs will adhere to [Google API Services User Data Policy](https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy), including the Limited Use requirements.

### How Long We Keep Information

We generally discard information about you when it's no longer needed for the purposes for which we collect and use it — described in the section above on How and Why We Use Information — and we're not legally required to keep it.

For example, we keep web server logs that record information about a visitor to one of Chrono's websites, like the visitor's IP address, browser type, and operating system, for approximately 30 days. We retain the logs for this period of time in order to, among other things, analyze traffic to Chrono's websites and investigate issues if something goes wrong on one of our websites.

As another example, when you delete a post, page, or comment from your WordPress.com site, it stays in your Trash folder for thirty days in case you change your mind and would like to restore that content, because starting from scratch is no fun. After the thirty days are up, the deleted content may remain on our backups and caches until purged.

### Security

While no online service is 100% secure, we work very hard to protect information about you against unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction, and take reasonable measures to do so. We monitor our Services for potential vulnerabilities and attacks.

### Your Rights

If you are located in certain parts of the world, including some US states and countries that fall under the scope of the European General Data Protection Regulation (aka the "GDPR"), you may have certain rights regarding your personal information, like the right to request access to or deletion of your data.

#### *European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)*

If you are located in a country that falls under the scope of the GDPR, data protection laws give you certain rights with respect to your personal data, subject to any exemptions provided by the law, including the rights to:

-   Request access to your personal data;
-   Request correction or deletion of your personal data;
-   Object to our use and processing of your personal data;
-   Request that we limit our use and processing of your personal data; and
-   Request portability of your personal data.

You also have the right to make a complaint to a government supervisory authority.

#### *US Privacy Laws*

Laws in some US states, including California, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah, and Virginia, require us to provide residents with additional information about the categories of personal information we collect and share, where we get that personal information, and how and why we use it. You'll find that information in this section (if you are a California resident, please note that this is the Notice at Collection we are required to provide you under California law).

In the last 12 months, we collected the following categories of personal information, depending on the Services used:

-   Identifiers (like your name, contact information, and device and online identifiers);
-   Commercial information (your billing information and purchase history, for example);
-   Characteristics protected by law (for example, you might provide your gender as part of a research survey for us or you may choose to voluntarily disclose your race or veteran status as part of your job application);
-   Internet or other electronic network activity information (such as your usage of our Services, like the actions you take as an administrator of a WordPress.com site);
-   Geolocation data (such as your location based on your IP address);
-   Audio, electronic, visual or similar information (such as your profile picture, if you uploaded one);
-   Professional or employment-related information (for example, your company and team information if you are a Happy Tools user, or information you provide in a job application); and
-   Inferences we make (such as likelihood of retention or attrition).

If you are a job applicant, we may have also collected:

-   Education information, such as the education you disclose in your job application.

You can find more information about what we collect and sources of that information in the *Information We Collect* above.

We collect personal information for the business and commercial purposes described in the *How and Why We Use Information section*. And we share this information with the categories of third parties described in the *Sharing Information section*. We retain this information for the length of time described in our *How Long We Keep Information section*.

In some US states you have additional rights subject to any exemptions provided by your state's respective law, including the right to:

-   Request a copy of the specific pieces of information we collect about you and, if you're in California, to know the categories of personal information we collect, the categories of business or commercial purpose for collecting and using it, the categories of sources from which the information came, and the categories of third parties we share it with;
-   Request deletion of personal information we collect or maintain;
-   Request correction of personal information we collect or maintain;
-   Opt out of the sale or sharing of personal information;
-   Receive a copy of your information in a readily portable format; and
-   Not receive discriminatory treatment for exercising your rights.

***Right to Opt Out***

We never directly sell your personal information in the conventional sense (i.e., for money).

We may share your information as necessary with our third-party service providers to provide our services to you. To the extent that we share your information with certain advertising, marketing, or analytics vendors, this can be considered a "sale" or "share" in certain U.S. States, which you may have the right to opt out of.

You can learn more about this sharing and how to opt out by clicking the "Do Not Sell My Personal Information" link in the footer of our websites, or from the settings page within our apps. Note that in some instances this link will only display to individuals visiting our sites from within the relevant states.

Our opt-out is managed through cookies, so if you delete cookies, your browser is set to delete cookies automatically after a certain length of time, or if you visit sites in a different browser, you'll need to make this selection again.

We also respect the GPC browser signal and will treat it as a valid means of communicating your desire to opt out.

We do not collect or process your sensitive (and potentially sensitive) personal information except where it is strictly necessary to provide you with our service, where the processing is not for the purpose of inferring characteristics about you, or for other purposes that do not require an option to limit under California law. We don't knowingly sell or share personal information of those under 16.

***Your Information & Personalized Advertising***

Our mission is to democratize publishing and commerce, and that means making our Services accessible to as many people as possible. We show ads on some of our users' sites as well as some of our own sites, and the revenue these ads generate lets us offer free access to some of our Services so that money doesn't become an obstacle to having a voice. Our ads program also allows our users to earn revenue to support and grow their own sites. As part of our advertising program, we and our users do use cookies to share certain device identifiers and information about your browsing activities with our advertising partners, and those advertising partners may use that information to show you personalized ads on some of our users' sites and some of our own.

The personal information we share includes online identifiers; internet or other network or device activity (such as cookie information, other device identifiers, and IP address); and geolocation data (approximate location information from your IP address). These disclosures may be considered a "sale" or "share" of information under some US state privacy laws. We do not sell (or share) information through our ads program that identifies you personally, like your name or contact information. Learn how you can opt out by going to[ Advertising on WordPress.com Sites and Sites in the WordAds Program](https://wordpress.com/advertising-program-optout/).

#### *Contacting Us About These Rights*

You can usually access, correct, or delete your personal data using your account settings and tools that we offer, but if you aren't able to or you'd like to contact us about one of the other rights, scroll down to *How to Reach Us* to, find out how to reach us.

When you contact us about one of your rights under this section, we'll need to verify that you are the right person before we disclose or delete anything. For example, if you are a user, we will need you to contact us from the email address associated with your account. You can also designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf by giving us written authorization. We may still require you to verify your identity with us.

### How to Reach Us

If you have a question about this Privacy Policy, or you would like to contact us about any of the rights mentioned in the Your Rights section above, please contact us at hello@rechrono.com

### Children's Privacy

Our Services are not intended for use by children under the age of 18 (“Child” or “Children”).

We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from Children under 18. If you become aware that a Child has provided us with Personal Data, please contact us. If we become aware that we have collected Personal Data from Children without verification of parental consent, we take steps to remove that information from our servers.

### Privacy Policy Changes

Although most changes are likely to be minor, Chrono may change its Privacy Policy from time to time.

Chrono encourages visitors to check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy.

If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the change log below, and, in some cases, we may provide additional notice (like adding a statement to our) or sending you a notification through email or your dashboard). Your further use of the Services after a change to our Privacy Policy will be subject to the updated policy.
