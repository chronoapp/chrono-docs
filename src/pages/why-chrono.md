## Why Chrono?

Every creation begins with how we choose to spend our time.

Time is our most valuable asset, yet tools for managing it are outdated, dominated by a few companies like Google and Microsoft.

Their calendars, integrated with cloud and email services, track our deadlines, events, and obligations but are capable of much more.

### Principles

#### Calendar as a source of truth

A calendar shouldn't just remind us of appointments; it should be a comprehensive record of our time usage. This includes invoicing, to-do lists, analytics, and even personal contact management.

Using the calendar, we can both reflect on the past and plan the future. We can analyze time spent on different activities, like design, marketing, and meetings in a sprint, or study hours correlating to test scores.

It also helps track personal interactions, like the frequency of meetings with friends.

#### Time blocking and deep work

Time blocking is an intentional planning strategy for daily tasks, enhancing productivity.

Even if the nature of the work is reactive or open-ended like putting out fires at work, there's no reason you can't block that out too.

The calendar should be a dynamic tool, adaptable as commitments change.

#### Privacy and open source

Unlike the walled gardens of Google and Microsoft, which store data indefinitely, Chrono will be open-core for essential features. Control over personal data, including events and contacts, is vital as it is inherently yours
